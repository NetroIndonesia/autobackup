# Automated Backup System

## Overview

This Node.js application automates the process of backing up a specified folder and handling the backup file based on its size. The backup can be uploaded to File.io for temporary storage or sent directly to a webhook if the file size is below a specified threshold.

## Features

- **Automated Backup:** Creates a compressed backup of a specified folder.
- **File Size Handling:** Uploads backups larger than a specified size to File.io or sends smaller backups directly to a webhook.
- **Configurable:** Allows configuration through a JSON file or user input.
- **Scheduled Backups:** Uses cron jobs to schedule backups at specified intervals.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NetroIndonesia/autobackup.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```
    cd automated-backup-system
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

The application reads configuration from `config.json` or from user input. The `config.json` file should be in the following format:

```
{
    "folderToBackup": "path/to/folder",
    "backupFolder": "./backups",
    "webhooks": [
        "https://your-webhook-url1",
        "https://your-webhook-url2"
    ],
    "cooldownDuration": "*/60 * * * *" // Cron expression for scheduling
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `folderToBackup`: Path to the folder you want to back up.
- `backupFolder`: Path where backups will be stored.
- `webhooks`: List of webhook URLs to which backups will be sent.
- `cooldownDuration`: Cron expression to schedule backups.

## Usage

1. **Start the application:**

    ```
    node index.js
    ```

2. **Follow the prompts** or ensure `config.json` is correctly configured.

3. **Monitor output:** The application will log the status of backups and any issues encountered.

## Cron Jobs

The backup scheduler uses the `node-cron` library to run backups at intervals specified by the `cooldownDuration` parameter. The default value is set to every hour.

## Error Handling

- If a backup process fails, an error message will be logged.
- If a backup file is too large for direct webhook upload, it will be uploaded to File.io.
